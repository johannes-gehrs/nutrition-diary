# Nutrimaid - Nutrition Diary

This is a personal tool I use to keep track of the stuff I eat.

It's a Django app. It's probably not useful to anyone else unless

- you live in Germany, Switzerland or Austria
- you speak German
- you want to use fantasy points to calculate how much you've eaten
- you want to install a tool for this on your own server
- you want to use fddb.info (an online food database) to get the food data, e. g. you do not want to maintain this manually.

This app scrapes the food data from fddb.info on demand, so it's probbaly not legal to use it on a
commercial scale, depending on your jurisdiction.

If you actually want to use this and run into trouble installing it contact me. I've used Python 2.7.

Thanks to http://glyphicons.com/ for providing an icon of a kettle. You can click the icon and
then it will wobble.
